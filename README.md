### Purpose

The purpose of this README is to teach you how to host a markdown resume on Github Pages using a Jekyll as a static site generator. 
Additionally, the steps taken will be related to the general principles of technical communication as described in Andrew Etter's book: *Modern Technical Writing*.

### Prerequisites

 * A resume formatted in Markdown.
 
### Instructions

#### Creating the Website
If we want to host our resume on Github Pages, the first thing we'll need is a website to host. 
The easiest way to do this is with a static-site generator, which will automatically create a website and allow for easy modification.
These instructions will go over how to do that using *Jekyll*. 
However, if you plan on using another static-site generator, you can skip to the section: **Hosting the Website**, to see how to host a website with Github Pages.
